'''DotaChat'''

What is DotaChat?
- DotaChat is a chatting app built specifically for dota2 players, but anyone can use it.

Why did I build it?
- I enjoy playing dota and I have many dota friends, so I decided to build something for them.

How it works?
- Step 1:
    - Run 'npm install --prefix client' or cd to client then run 'npm install'.
- Step 2:
    - Run 'pipenv install' then 'pipenv shell'.
    - cd to server and run 'python app.py'

Enjoy the app!
